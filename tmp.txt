RCA Summary:During the incident triage, team came to know that license was not properly synced with the RMA device due to that number of access points could not be associated with WLC cluster, post which CISCO TAC arranged the license file which was used to upload in the WLC for association of access points. After that License has been installed and team rebooted the controller together. All APs got connected to WLC, and issue got resolved. Team also raised a Cisco TAC case (694944684).

After that License has been installed and team rebooted the controller together. All APs got connected to WLC, and issue got resolved. Team also raised a Cisco TAC case (694944684).
Root Cause:WIFI Network services were suspended at multiple locations due to which users were unable to connect to WIFI network. On analysis it was found that the required license file was missing for which team contacted cisco TAC, got the license, and deployed it, post which the issue got resolved. However, this license availability in configuration was highlighted to Cisco TAC during the addition of RMA device at prior night where Cisco TAC responded that license file is already available, and they demonstrated the count of access points at WLC management console. As a part of verification team also moved to multiple floors where they did not observe any disconnection. Later (Post incident resolution) team identified that during the verification period access points were connected to WLC via default license. As a learning team would check the connected access point details instead of access point summary count.

Root Cause:Users were not able to access the Servosys Application because the application was not connecting to DB. 
SQL worker thread was exhausted and due to this no new connections were connecting . 
This has happened because the application team triggered the new job (SSSD-Servodoc-mig) to transfer docs from application server to bank DMS. To fix the issue SQL team took restart (failover and fail back) of SQL services. Also, the Jboss middleware services on the application server were restarted.
As a lessons learnt, the application team will be informed to optimize the query to ensure that worker threads are not exhausted. IBM Guardium S-tap services were also stopped and an OEM case has been raised to find out if this could have contributed to the issue.

Root Cause:Team was performing SV motion of the Vcenter7 server which was built on NFS datastore to VMFS datastore. As continuing in NFS datastore would increase the risk of performance of Vcenter server and migrating to VMFS datastore is the recommended practice and however team unfortunately build datastore in NFS datastore which caused the outage.

Incident Resolution Details:nan
RCA Summary:The issue was started at 11 March, 23 8:24 AM where Multiple application like Intranet Canteen application, TSL app store, etc. was not accessible. The issue was caused due to the Database on Groupmisprd server not accepting the connection request from the application as the database was in hung state. Oracle team has also observed increase in swap out, I/O, disk latency along that oracle processes were in blocked state. However, there is no conclusive evidence for the root cause of swap out, I/O and disk latency as snapshot with memory was not taken before VM reboot was initiated. Post the reboot of server on 3/11/2023  9:36:13 AM all the services were up and running and customer also confirmed that all the services were accessible from the customer end as well.

RCA Summary:During the incident window- the server was taking longer than necessary, Kyndryl Technical team tried to hard reboot the server and tried to bring the server up via the safe mode. The Reboot of the safe mode took longer than necessary as the repair processes were running in the backend and there was no way to understand the progress of the reboot during the safe mode. The server came back online via the safe mode, and the team performed a check disk command and performed the health check of the server. The COB was initiated.

Root Cause:The possible cause is that if, the Error Control value set to 3, the service will prevent server from booting up when it detects error during booting up process. It is hence, not being feasible to provide an RCA about what happened to the Server by backtracking in time. The reason for this is because in windows Server 2012 the BCD has a default setting for RecoveryEnabled Yes.

RCA Summary:nan
Root Cause:Multiple alerts received in solar winds mentioning that the access point is disconnected from the controller. Team cross checked and observed that IP Phone, Hotline, FIDS, ACS and ROIP were partially impacted across both terminal 1 and Terminal 2, Team observed that there were authentication failure for multiple devices in ISE logs. The security team had purging policy enabled as per Approved SR29067 which was implemented 2 APR 23 11:00 Hrs with purging of data schedule at 3:00 Hrs every day in consideration that the policy was to remove devices which are inactive for more than 90 days. However purging policy created was for removing devices which are added in ISE and has elsaped more than 90 days to be removed irrespective of whether the end points are active or inactive. Due the same all devices which had elapsed greater than 90 days were removed . Team restored the endpoints using back up copy which was taken prior to enabling the purging policy . Initially team faced an issues with restoring 4000 + endpoint out of 16000 endpoints. The same was identified a sequenqutial issue with Excel backup copy with assistance of Cisco TAC. Once the sequential issue in excel was corrected the team was able to restore the same .  Post restoration using the backup copy all 16000 endpoint were restored . For few end point manual intervention were required , where in few ports were bounced , End points were restarted .

RCA Summary:•	Since VM was in inaccessible state, VM team tried to restart VM.
•	There were 2 drives (J & K) which were presented from the impacted datastore. Hence, the same was unmapped from the VM and powered on with 7 other LUNs which are hosted on other datastores.
•	Team logged a case with VMWare vendor (#23420954804) and started investigation.
•	As per the initial investigation by VMWare vendor, the partition table on the datastore is corrupted. So, The VMWare recreated the partition table. Post recreation, the NAA ID was pointing to the new datastore name (DS 14 instead of DS 11) and new UUID. 
•	Mounted the restored datastore and found no data available in it.
•	VMWare confirmed that the data recovery is not possible. Team collected the logs and shared with VMware for further analysis.
•	Except Drive: D, no other drives were a part of the backup policy. Hence, restoration was not feasible.
•	The data from DR server has been mapped as a network drive on DC Server so that users can access the required data.
•	Parallelly, as a workaround VM team provisioned 2 new drives ‘M (2 TB)’ and ‘J (4 TB)’ on the OmniDocs server from new datastore and application team started copying files from DR to DC for testing.
•	Since the data recovery was not possible in DC, BLI & Kyndryl mutually agreed to copy 4 TB data from DR to DC and consequently application team configured Omni Docs application on the DC Server.
•	The data copying from DR to DC was initiated and could take up to 96 hours for full recovery.

Root Cause:There was a request to expand J drive on OmniDocs server. However, adequate space was not available in datastore, So existing LUN was expanded by 1TB to provisioned the space in Datastore. Team tried to expand the Datastore using ESXi & V-centre GUI mode. However, expansion through GUI didn’t work. As a next action, CLI command was executed. Since this command was incorrect, DS11 datastore got formatted.

RCA Summary:On 15/05/23 at 12:02 hrs, a monitoring alert indicated intermittent inaccessibility of SAP services for end users. The IC4SAP infrastructure support team observed three instances of network tunnel flapping, which affected users attempting to access the SAP application through VPN. The network team attempted a network failover from node 0 to node 1 after business hours, but the latency issue persisted. As a result, the failover was reverted back to node 0. The root cause of the network tunnel flapping has not yet been identified, and an OEM case has been raised with IBM Cloud for further investigation.

Incident Resolution Details:nan
RCA Summary:On 5/23/2023 at 11:06:00 PM, monitoring alerts were received for Node A (TSLS4PRODDB). Initial investigation revealed that Node A had rebooted, leading to an automatic failover to Node B. Applications were successfully running on Node B as the primary server. The OS team conducted hardware sanity checks and additional diagnostic tests, finding no hardware issues. Further investigation by the IC4SAP teams did not identify an immediate root cause.

Subsequently, Kyndryl raised tickets with the respective OEM support for additional information. However, the OEMs were unable to determine the exact cause of the reboot based on the available logs. The IBM Cloud/Lenovo support provided an update, stating that the installed firmware on the system is outdated. They recommended planning for a firmware upgrade, as the latest version offers multiple fixes and enhancements. Additionally, the SUSE OEM advised upgrading the OS version from SUSE 12 to SUSE 15 for improved system stability, as the current OS version reached its end-of-life (EOL) by the end of June.

Incident Resolution Details:nan
RCA Summary:Initially issue is reported for Poornata HRMs portal is not working, after that issue was observed that multiple VMs were not reachable post ESX upgrade activity (version 6.5 to 6.7 U3). During the investigation along with VMWare TAC team it was found that updated NSX Vibs were not getting pushed to 4 ESXI which were upgraded as a part of planned change. Later it found that due to issue with EAM the communication between NSX and VCenter was broken which was reason behind Vibs not getting pushed to upgraded ESXI host. To resolve the issue with EAM the extension certificate on VCenter Server has been updated.
After fixing the issue with EAM on vCenter the communication between NSX and VCenter got established post which NSX Vibs were pushed to ESXI hosts and ESXI host became reachable.

Incident Resolution Details:nan
RCA Summary:nan
Root Cause:While port speed of base1&2 in blade#7 of chassis-2 was modified, this replicated to two clustered blades in chassis#1, hence causing base link of two blades of the master chassis going down. Fabric interface was UP at that time, but the status of that blade was in Active/Working/Running State. Forti-Controller considered the blade to be in working status which impacted the production traffic on those blades only.

OEM TAM has acknowledged that they were not aware of this scenario and product behavior. After further lab analysis, Engineering team has acknowledged the blade working status to be a bug and the fix for the same is being worked upon.

Description of Incident:Users were unable to take RDP on 10.6.41.212
Business Impact:Qlikview application was down
Incident Resolution Details:nan
RCA Summary:It was reported that users were unable to take RDP on the server 10.6.41.212 
Thus, QlikView application was not accessible. VM team identified that backup was still running on the server and old snapshots were also present. Hence, RDP was not happening. However, backup got completed and then server was accessible. VM team had raised a case with VMware support (23443409106) and as per VMware recommendation backup server must be rebooted and VM team to perform manual disk consolidation on 10.6.41.212 and other impacted servers as well (Shared in email). ECR (CH75820) was raised to reboot the backup server 10.11.41.16
Then VM team performed the consolidation activity post which the server was up and running fine.
Root Cause:This issue stemmed from lack of backup proxies in the infrastructure. Only one server is available that functions as both backup server and proxy server. It was singlehandedly managing multiple backup jobs which caused delay and overutilization of the backup server

Root Cause:IBM STAP agent being enabled due to which all SQL net communications will be scanned by IBM STAP agent and any rule defined on the network layer will further cause delay resulting in network latency. After the STAP was disabled, no incidents were reported by the client.

RCA Summary:On 23rd July 2023, the connectivity from the customer's premises to the IC4SAP servers in managed apps environment was impacted due to the IPSEC VPN tunnel going down. Network team troubleshooted and brought back the connectivity by resetting the VPN tunnel. The traffic flow however remained intermittent and in order to resolved this, it was decided to shift the traffic from the Primary VSRX node to the Secondary VSRX node and later placed that node as a standalone without HA. Post this the network connectivity became stable and was monitored closely. However, the issue resurfaced on 24th July 2023 and to resolve this, network team bounced the tunnel and enabled Power mode at firewall level as recommended by Juniper OEM. Since then the network connectivity has been stable and no further issues have been observed

RCA Summary:1st instance occurred on 27th Apr-23 - A multiple MAC-flap was observed in VLAN 1 at 12:43:20 PM, causing intermittent network fluctuations, and multiple access switches experienced intermittent packet drops. Logging into the TMH DS, for further troubleshooting revealed that the MAC address was flapping between ports Gi0/50 and Gi0/44. After disabling the switch port Gi0/44, the MAC flapping stopped, and the network was restored at 12:52 PM.

2nd instance occurred on 28th Apr-23 – Again, Mac flapping was triggered in vlan 1 at 05:47:01 AM, causing intermittent network fluctuations, and multiple access switches experienced intermittent packet drops. Further troubleshooting revealed that the MAC address was flapping between ports Gi1/0/7 and Gi1/0/11, Gi1/0/12, Gi1/0/10, etc. This resulted in layer 2 loop formation. We disabled the common switch port Gi1/0/7 of switch 170.0.111.114, the MAC flapping stopped, and the network was restored at 6:15 AM. Switches were unreachable, which related to uplink port Gi1/0/7 (10 nodes of switches). We went to the switch location of 170.0.111.118 and logged in to the switch using the console cable, and we found mac flapping was observed on switch ports Gi1/0/2 and Gi1/0/12 of switch 170.0.111.118. Disabled the Gi1/0/2 and enabled the Gi1/0/7 to restore the rest switches, which were down. Further, we have checked and found one access switch (170.0.111.112) was malfunctioning that was causing mac flapping. We have removed and replaced the malfunctioning switch.
